## 💰 Cost Management

All projects are designed with cost optimization in mind:

- ✅ **Free tier resources** used wherever possible
- ✅ **Cleanup reminders** after each module
- ✅ **Cost guides** included in each project
- ✅ **AZ-305 is mostly design work** (minimal Azure spend)

**Estimated costs:**
| Project | Estimated Cost |
|---------|----------------|
| AZ-104 | $10-30 |
| AZ-305 | $0-10 |
| AI-102 | $15-50 |

## 📖 Learning Approach

Each project follows a **building blocks** methodology:

1. **Start Simple** → Basic concepts and single-resource exercises
2. **Add Complexity** → Multi-resource scenarios and integrations
3. **Real-World Scenarios** → Fictional company context throughout
4. **Capstone** → Complete end-to-end project demonstrating all skills

### Fictional Companies

| Project | Company | Scenario |
|---------|---------|----------|
| AZ-104 | Contoso Consulting | Growing IT consultancy migrating to Azure |
| AZ-305 | Northwind Traders | Global e-commerce company designing for scale |
| AI-102 | IntelliHealth | Healthcare tech startup building AI platform |
